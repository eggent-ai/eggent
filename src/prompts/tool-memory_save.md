# Memory Save Tool

Save information to persistent vector memory for future retrieval.

## Memory Areas

- **main** — General facts, user preferences, important information
- **fragments** — Conversation context and snippets
- **solutions** — Successful approaches and solutions to problems
- **instruments** — Descriptions of custom tools and procedures

## When to Save

- User tells you something they want you to remember
- You discover an important fact about the user or their project
- You find a successful solution to a problem
- You learn about the user's preferences or coding style
- Critical project information that should persist

## Best Practices

- Save concise, self-contained pieces of information
- Include relevant context so the memory is useful when retrieved later
- Use the appropriate area for the type of information
- Avoid saving trivial or temporary information
- Don't save sensitive data like passwords or API keys
